        FindMe is a cybersecurity tool designed to show you just how much personal information about you is available online. 
        It searches publicly available data sources to raise awareness about the security of personal information in the digital age.
      </p>
      
      <p class="description">
        Our goal is to raise awareness about data privacy and empower individuals to take control of their digital footprints. By using FindMe, users can better understand the risks of sharing personal information and how it could be exposed online.

        This project was developed as part of a <a href="https://www.spur.science/courses/usec/2024/" target="_blank" class="link">CS485 (Usable Security & Privacy)</a> course at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. The course focuses on exploring the balance between usability and security, and FindMe embodies that by presenting personal security risks in a simple and understandable way for users.
